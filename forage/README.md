Hello Everyone.

This is my work on the forage virtual lyft internship. I got to work on designing better backend architecture for the
proper functioning of lyft automobile vehicles.
I did a lot of codebase refactoring and this helped me improve my OOP knowledge as well as getting a good grasp of
design patterns.
Afterwards i wrote unit tests. Stressful and boring to write but very important.
